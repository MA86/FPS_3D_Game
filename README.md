Created a 3D first-person shooter (FPS) game using Unity framework. It's a prototype.

Here is a link to a video showing this game: [https://vimeo.com/439092111](https://vimeo.com/439092111)


The book I read for this project is called, Unity in Action: Multiplatform Game Development in C#, 2nd Edition (Hocking).
